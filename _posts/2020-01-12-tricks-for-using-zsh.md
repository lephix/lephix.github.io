title: Tricks for using Zsh
---

## Introduction
Zsh is a terminal command like bash and sh. 

It is so popular for developers who would love to using terminal other than graphic interface.

There is a project named oh-my-zsh, which contains a lot of well configured profiles for Zsh. Users could beautify the terminal within a minute. This article records how to install and config Zsh in my environment.

## Environment
I am using WSL Ubuntu 18.04 in Win10. After 5 years using Mac, I got a chance back to use Windows again. I'd like to use a Mac, but the price is a little bit higher than what I think a computer should take. And after 2 months using Windows, I think it much better than before.

WSL is short for Windows Subsystm for Linux, which lets user have a pure Linux environment within Windows. Differ than Virtualization solution like VirtualBox, the WSL could be launched in 5 secondes, users could get almost totally same terminal experiences like in Linux or Mac.
